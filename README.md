npm install
```

4. 🔐 Obtain the `.env.local` file from a project administrator (Riho or Nima) and place it in the root directory of the project.

### Running the Application

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

🌐 The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 🔍 Verifying Installation

Once the application is running, you should be able to:
- View the homepage at http://localhost:3000
- Access the admin dashboard (if you are authorized)
- See the booking interface

## 🔒 Environment Variables

This project relies on environment variables for secure configuration. Important notes:
- Request the `.env.local` file from project admin or another dev
- Never commit the `.env` file to version control
- Keep the environment variables secure and confidential


## 🧪 Testing the Application

This application includes a testing suite to ensure any potential bugs are caught before deployment. Here's how to run the tests and what tools to use.

#### Testing Tools
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/):** A unit testing framework for testing individual components and utilities.
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/):** A tool for end-to-end (E2E) testing, ensuring that the entire user experience works as expected.

#### Available Test Scripts
In the `package.json` file, the following test scripts are defined:

- **Unit Tests:** Run tests for individual units or components of the app.
  ```bash
  npm run test:unit
  ```
  Uses **Vitest** for fast and efficient unit testing.

- **End-to-End Tests:** Run comprehensive tests simulating user interactions.
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
  Uses **Playwright** to verify that the application functions as expected from a user's perspective.

- **All Tests:** Run both unit and end-to-end tests sequentially.
  ```bash
  npm run test:all
  ```

#### Running Tests
1. Ensure the application is installed and up to date:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Make sure the environemnt variables below are set accordingly: 
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRANCH_NAME=development
   CI=true
   TEST_EMAIL_ADDRESS=<YOUR_TEST_EMAIL_ADDRESS>
   TEST_PASSWORD=<YOUR_TEST_EMAIL_PASSWORD>
   ```
2. Run the desired test script:
   - For unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
   - For E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
   - For all tests: `npm run test:all`

3. View the results in the console. Fix any failing tests before proceeding with development or deployment.

#### Notes
- **Environment:** Ensure you have the **development** `.env.local` file properly configured for your testing environment.
- **Playwright Setup:** If running Playwright tests for the first time, install the required browsers:
  ```bash
  npx playwright install
  ```
